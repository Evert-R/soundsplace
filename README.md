### still miles away from finished

Note: This project started with me wanting to learn how to make a user registration /login /logout system using PHP. From there it got a bit out of hand and became the project wich I use to test out all my newly learned techniques.

The basic function of this project is that it creates a social platform for musicians where they can upload their new made tracks, accompanied by a message, on wich the other musicians can react, and so discuss their new creation.

It should be easy to install this on your own webserver and so create an environment with a selected number of people.
